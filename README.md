# Stock Price Prediction with RNN

A simple example of how to use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to predict stock prices using historical stock data.

## About the Project

This project uses Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn to analyze and predict stock prices for a specific company (e.g., Apple) from a dataset containing stock data. It covers data preprocessing, model creation using RNNs, and evaluation of the model's predictions.

## Data Source

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500) used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. You can find the dataset and related information on Kaggle's website.
